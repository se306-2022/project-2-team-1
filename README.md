### Three Module Structure
For this project, we decided to use a three module structure to separate the different components. These components
were the CLI (Command Line Interface), Core (containing graph models and algorithms)
and the GUI (Graphical User Interface).

The CLI module contains all code relating to passing graph input through the command line. This includes checking input
validity as well as converting to into our created graph models to then run through our algorithms.

As mentioned about, important components such as the graph models are located in the Core module. This module also
contains our algorithms and their initial prototypes.

Lastly, the GUI modules contains all components relating to the visualisation of the scheduler including specific
user views and layout constraints.

The justification behind this design decision was to keep all components for these three large modules
together whilst not overloading the main project with an excessive amount of files and directories.
